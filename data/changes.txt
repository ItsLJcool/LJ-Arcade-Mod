[ 2.2.1 Alpha ]
• Finally Fixed the Ratings Issue. Properly displays the rating (based on `generateAccuracy` in `ScoreText`)
• Reduced token gains from 50 => 20.
• Might have fixed an issue with titlescreen. Apparently there is no `titlescreen` folder in base YCE.
• Fixed a bug where it would say you failed a challenge, but played the song in freeplay.
• Fixed an issue where Mods with `.` in the folder name would be excluded from the list. (Might have been last update, i forgor)

• Added Gamebanana release (for promotion)

[ Next Update Goals ]
• Shop
• More Customizability for Mods to mess around with
• XP Milestones
• More ways to get LJ Tokens
• Button to add YCE Mods (?)
