## Mod Info
This mod was an Idea for a while, but I guess my brain was too small to understand Haxe, now that I have a grip on Haxe.
I can make YCE have Infinite content as long as there are mods to play.

Once I figured out how to use Yoshi's old System for loading any mod in freeplay, I was able to make this (Its so easy, literally 6 lines of code and the rest is handled by YCE.)
Took me ~1 day of coding (not counting days inbetween), it took a week to do, since me brain died.

# Q & A:
Q: Why do this on YoshiCrafterEngine? I mean its like the engine is Outdated, slow, and Not many mods are made on here.
A: Every YCE Copy is personalized :) (but for real, idk just felt like it :trollface:)

Q: Whats the point in this mod?
A: To give purpose to YCE again, and give people somewhat of a reason to mod in YCE, you can do a lot of shit in that bitch.
